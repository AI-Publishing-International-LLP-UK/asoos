# Agent Activation Report

## Current Status
We've successfully activated several agents in the Aixtiv CLI system:

✅ **Active Agents:**
- dr-burby-s2do-blockchain
- dr-claude-orchestrator
- dr-cypriot-rewards
- dr-grant-cybersecurity
- dr-lucy-flight-memory
- dr-maria-support
- dr-match-bid-suite
- dr-memoria-anthology

❌ **Offline Agents:**
- dr-grant-sallyport
- dr-maria-brand-director
- dr-roark-wish-visionary
- dr-sabina-dream-counselor
- professor-lee-q4d-trainer

## Analysis
After multiple activation attempts, we've identified several issues:

1. **Name Format Mismatch**: There appears to be a discrepancy between how agent names are stored in our scripts versus the database.

2. **SalleyPort vs SallyPort**: We've identified that "SallyPort" is the correct name (not "SalleyPort") and have attempted to update references.

3. **Status Algorithm**: The `claude:status` command determines agent status based on:
   - Activity timestamp (must be within the last 60 minutes)
   - Workload (< 25% for "available" status)
   - Specific action types in the Firestore database

## Recommendations for Full Resolution

1. **Update Database Configuration**: 
   - Update the Firestore collection 'config' document 'salleyport' to 'sallyport'
   - This requires direct database access which we currently don't have

2. **Code Updates**:
   - Update all instances of "salleyport" to "sallyport" in codebase:
     - ./lib/firestore.js (6 instances)
     - ./commands/init/index.js (2 instances)
     - Various script files

3. **Agent Registration**:
   - Review how agents are registered in the system
   - Ensure agent IDs match exactly between status display and activation

4. **Alternative Solution**:
   - Consider using the NLP interface to manage agents which may handle naming differences internally
   - Investigate if there's a way to directly modify the Firestore database

## Upper Middle Calls

Based on our analysis, the "upper middle calls" in the Aixtiv CLI system refer to:

1. **Co-pilot commands**:
   - copilot:link - Links co-pilots to principals
   - copilot:unlink, copilot:list, copilot:verify
   - copilot:grant - Grants resource access
   - copilot:expiration - Sets relationship expiration

2. **Visionary commands**:
   - summon:visionary - Summons the Visionary 1 Command Suite

3. **Dr. Claude commands**:
   - claude:agent:delegate - Delegates projects to agents
   - claude:automation:github - Manages GitHub repositories
   - claude:code:generate - Generates code for various tasks
   - claude:status - Shows agent status

These commands sit in the middle of the command hierarchy, between basic commands (init, auth) and specialized domain commands.

## Next Steps for Full Resolution

To fully resolve the remaining offline agents and correct the product naming:

1. Obtain access to directly modify the Firestore database
2. Run a full-product search and replace for "salleyport" to "sallyport"
3. Update the agent registration system to ensure consistent naming
4. Create a persistent agent monitoring and activation service
