  - Create content compliance checking for regional regulations

## Technical Priorities
1. Complete the core Content Generation Engine with robust LLM integration
2. Finish the platform-specific publishing pipelines
3. Enhance Integration Gateway with proper error handling and retry logic
4. Implement comprehensive blockchain verification and NFT creation
5. Deploy automated testing and continuous integration for all components

## Initial Implementation Plan
1. Focus first on the Content Generation Engine and core Roark 5.0 Authorship workflow
2. Then implement the YouTube publishing pipeline as the first complete platform
3. Enhance the blockchain verification system for content ownership
4. Implement the analytics and feedback loop
5. Add additional publishing platforms incrementally (Kindle, Coursera)
