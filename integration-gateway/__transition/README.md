# __transition Directory

## Purpose
This directory serves as a temporary holding area for files that were previously moved from the deprecated `/Users/as/asoos/aixtiv-symphony-opus1.0.1/` directory but may have been accidentally restored or recreated.

## Background
- The original migration of files from `aixtiv-symphony-opus1.0.1` to the new structure in `opus1.0.1` was completed last week
- The `aixtiv-symphony-opus1.0.1` directory is now deprecated and should no longer be used
- This transition directory was created on **May 28, 2025** to handle any remaining edge cases

## Usage Guidelines
1. If any files appear in the deprecated directory, they should be **moved** (not copied) here for evaluation
2. Files placed here should be reviewed to determine if they:
   - Need to be integrated into the proper location in the new structure
   - Are duplicates of already migrated files and can be discarded
   - Contain any unique changes that need to be merged

## Workflow
1. Move any newly discovered files from `/Users/as/asoos/aixtiv-symphony-opus1.0.1/` to this directory
2. Document the origin and purpose of these files
3. Evaluate each file to determine its disposition
4. Once all files have been properly sorted or discarded, this directory can be removed

## Important Notes
- Do NOT copy files - only move them to maintain a single source of truth
- This is a temporary solution until all remnants of the deprecated directory are properly handled
- Once all migration is complete, the original deprecated directory should be deleted entirely
