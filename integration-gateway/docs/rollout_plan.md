# Rollout Plan

This document describes the phased rollout plan for production changes, including pilot and agent clusters.

## Rollout Strategy

The Aixtiv Symphony uses a phased rollout strategy to minimize risk and ensure system stability. This approach allows for early detection of issues and gradual scaling of new features.

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Development and Testing

**Duration**: Ongoing
**Participants**: Development team
**Environment**: Development and staging environments

- Feature development and unit testing
- Integration testing
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Code review and approval

**Gate Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- Code coverage meets requirements
- Security scans show no critical vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks are met

### Phase 2: Pilot Deployment

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Participants**: Elite 11 and Mastery 33 pilot groups (44 AI pilots total)
**Environment**: Pilot cluster in production

The Elite 11 represents macro-level strategic oversight from Squadron 4, while Mastery 33 comprises RIX pilots distributed across Wing 1's three squadrons, providing operational mastery.

**Deployment Process**:
1. Deploy to pilot cluster infrastructure
2. Activate 44 AI pilots with owner-level permissions
3. Enable automated monitoring and telemetry
4. Conduct pilot team onboarding sessions

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical issues reported
- Performance metrics within acceptable range
- Positive feedback from pilot teams
- All automated health checks pass

**Monitoring**:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- User experience feedback
- Security incident monitoring

### Phase 3: Agent Cluster Expansion

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Participants**: Extended agent clusters (up to 20,000,000 agents)
**Environment**: Production agent clusters

**Deployment Process**:
1. Gradual rollout to agent clusters
2. Activate agents in batches of 1,000,000
3. Monitor system performance at each batch
4. Implement automatic scaling as needed

**Success Criteria**:
- System handles increased load without degradation
- Agent coordination and performance within SLA
- No data integrity issues
- Successful communication across all 24 time zones

### Phase 4: Full Production Rollout

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Participants**: All users and systems
**Environment**: Full production environment

**Deployment Process**:
1. Complete rollout to all production clusters
2. Enable all features for all user types
3. Monitor system-wide performance
4. Provide user training and support

**Success Criteria**:
- System stability maintained
- All user types can access appropriate features
- Performance SLAs met
- Support ticket volume within normal range

## Rollback Triggers

At any phase, rollback will be triggered if:

- Critical functionality failures
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Error rate > 1%
- Negative pilot/user feedback indicating system instability

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

- Daily standup reports during rollout
- Weekly stakeholder updates
- Immediate incident notifications
- Post-rollout retrospectives

### External Communication

- Pre-rollout announcements to users
- Feature availability notifications
- Incident communication as needed
- Post-rollout success announcements

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for API calls
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for critical operations
- **Agent Performance**: 98.5% response rate from agents
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.0/5.0 rating

### Monitoring Tools

- Real-time dashboards for system health
- Automated alerting for threshold breaches
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance profiling and APM
- Security monitoring and threat detection

## Support and Training

### Pilot Team Support

- Dedicated support channel during pilot phase
- Regular check-in meetings
- Rapid issue resolution commitment
- Training materials and documentation

### General User Support

- Updated help documentation
- Video tutorials and demos
- Community support forums
- Enhanced customer support during rollout

## Contingency Plans

### Partial Rollback

If issues are identified in specific components:
1. Isolate affected components
2. Roll back only problematic features
3. Maintain service for unaffected functionality
4. Accelerated fix and re-deployment

### Full Rollback

If system-wide issues occur:
1. Immediate rollback to previous stable version
2. Communication to all stakeholders
3. Root cause analysis
4. Updated rollout plan with additional safeguards

## Post-Rollout Activities

### Performance Review

- Analysis of rollout metrics
- Identification of lessons learned
- Documentation of best practices
- Process improvements for future rollouts

### Success Celebration

- Team recognition and celebration
- Stakeholder appreciation
- Success story documentation
- Knowledge sharing across teams
