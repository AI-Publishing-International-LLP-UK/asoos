# Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Aixtiv Symphony, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Testing Strategy

The Aixtiv Symphony employs a comprehensive testing strategy that includes multiple layers of testing to ensure the system's reliability, performance, and security.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are designed to test individual components and modules in isolation. These tests are fast-running and help catch issues early in the development process.

**Coverage Goals**: 90% code coverage for critical components, 80% for all components.

**Framework**: Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, pytest for Python.

**Location**: Tests are co-located with the source code in `__tests__` or `test/` directories.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work correctly together. These tests help identify issues that may arise when components interact with each other.

**Scope**: API endpoints, database interactions, third-party service integrations.

**Framework**: Jest with supertest for API testing, pytest with fixtures for Python.

**Location**: `integration-tests/` directory in each component.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios and test the entire system from the user interface to the backend services.

**Framework**: Playwright for web UI testing, custom scripts for API workflows.

**Location**: `e2e-tests/` directory at the project root.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests ensure the system can handle expected load and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Tools**: Artillery for load testing, Lighthouse for frontend performance.

**Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource utilization.

### Security Tests

Security tests identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the system meets security requirements.

**Tools**: OWASP ZAP, custom security scripts.

**Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data validation, API security.

## Test Execution

### Continuous Integration

All tests are automatically executed on every pull request and commit to the main branch using GitHub Actions.

### Test Environments

- **Development**: Local development environments
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment that mirrors production
- **Production**: Live environment (read-only monitoring tests only)

### Test Data Management

- Use synthetic test data for all automated tests
- Implement data factories for consistent test data generation
- Clean up test data after each test run

## Quality Gates

### Pre-merge Requirements

- All unit tests must pass
- Integration tests must pass
- Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds
- Security scans must show no critical vulnerabilities

### Pre-release Requirements

- Full test suite execution
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- End-to-end tests must pass
- Security audit completion

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Metrics

- Test execution time
- Test coverage percentage
- Flaky test identification
- Test failure trends

### Reporting

- Daily test reports sent to development team
- Weekly quality metrics dashboard
- Monthly test strategy review

## Rollback Testing

All production deployments include automated rollback tests to ensure the system can be quickly reverted if issues are detected.

**Rollback Criteria**:
- Critical functionality failures
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Security incidents
- Data integrity issues

For detailed rollback procedures, see the [Rollback Plan](./rollout_plan.md).
