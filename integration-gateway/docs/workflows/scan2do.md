# Scan-to-Do: Governance and Authorization Layer

## Overview

Scan-to-Do is AIXTIV's comprehensive governance and authorization layer that validates user intent, context, and permissions before any task is created or executed. It operates as the security backbone of the system, ensuring that all actions adhere to proper authorization protocols while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Purpose

- Confirm user intent through contextual analysis before task creation
- Validate appropriate permissions and authorization for each requested action
- Provide a governance framework for all system operations
- Ensure secure, compliant interaction without disrupting conversational flow

## Core Principles

1. **Intent Validation**: No action becomes a TODO until properly validated
2. **Context-Aware Authorization**: Permission is assessed based on full interaction context
3. **Invisible Security**: Governance checks occur without disrupting the conversational experience
4. **Continuous Verification**: Authorization is an ongoing process, not a one-time check

## Workflow

1. **Intent Detection**: System interprets conversational input to determine user intent
2. **Context Building**: Comprehensive context is assembled, including:
   - User identity and profile
   - Conversation history and flow
   - Environmental factors
   - Requested action parameters
3. **Permission Validation**: User's authorization to perform the intended action is verified
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential security and compliance implications are evaluated
5. **Authorization Decision**: Based on all factors, the action is either approved or denied
6. **Execution or Redirection**: Approved actions proceed; denied actions trigger appropriate responses

## Technical Implementation

Scan-to-Do functions as a comprehensive authorization middleware that:

- Processes all potential actions through a multi-stage verification pipeline
- Integrates with SallyPort authentication for identity confirmation
- Maintains context awareness across the entire session
- Applies rule-based and heuristic analysis to determine action validity

## Integration Points

- Functions as the governance layer for S2DO dialogue refinement
- Provides authorization framework for CLI entry operations
- Works with SallyPort authentication (currently owner-level access only)
- Validates all tool activations in background operations

## Security and Compliance

- Ensures all actions are properly authorized before execution
- Creates audit trails for governance and compliance purposes
- Enforces role-based access controls without exposing roles to users
- Prevents unauthorized access to background tools and resources

## Examples

### Conversational Authorization Flow

**User**: "Let's update the quarterly forecast."

**System (internally)**: 
1. Identifies intent to modify forecast data
2. Confirms user has appropriate permissions
3. Validates context is appropriate for this action
4. Checks if appropriate tools are available
5. Only then acknowledges and processes the request

**System (to user)**: "I'll help you update the quarterly forecast. What changes would you like to make?"

### Denied Action Handling

When a user requests an action that fails validation:

- The system maintains conversational flow without exposing the governance mechanism
- Appropriate redirection or clarification is provided
- The interaction continues without exposing the underlying authorization failure

## Deployment Status

Scan-to-Do is currently operational on the asoos.2100.cool interface with:
- Complete integration with S2DO dialogue refinement
- Full implementation of authorization workflows
- Integration with SallyPort authentication
- Owner-level access restrictions in place

## Relationship to Legacy Systems

Thunderbird has been formally retired as a governance entity. Scan-to-Do replaces and enhances its functionality with a more sophisticated, conversational authorization approach.
