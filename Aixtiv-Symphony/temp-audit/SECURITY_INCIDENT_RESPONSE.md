# üö® Security Incident Response: Exposed Secrets

## Immediate Actions Required

GitGuardian has detected **24+ exposed secrets** in your git history. Here's your action plan:

### 1. üîÑ Rotate ALL Exposed API Keys IMMEDIATELY

**OpenAI Keys:**
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Delete exposed keys: `sk-*` patterns from commits
- Generate new API keys
- Update all services using these keys

**Anthropic Claude Keys:**
- Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
- Revoke exposed keys: `sk-ant-*` patterns  
- Generate new API keys
- Update integration services

**GitHub Tokens:**
- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Delete exposed personal access tokens
- Revoke GitHub App tokens if exposed
- Generate new tokens with minimum required permissions

**Google API Keys:**
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Delete exposed API keys
- Generate new keys with proper restrictions
- Update GCP service configurations

**Atlassian Tokens:**
- Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
- Revoke exposed access tokens
- Generate new tokens

**LangChain API Keys:**
- Access your LangChain account
- Revoke exposed keys
- Generate replacement keys

### 2. üîç Audit Account Activity

For each compromised service:
- Check access logs for unusual activity
- Review recent API usage
- Look for unauthorized access or changes
- Monitor billing for unexpected charges

### 3. üßπ Clean Git History (CRITICAL)

The secrets are in git history and will remain accessible until removed:

```bash
# Option 1: Use git filter-repo (recommended)
pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --path-glob '**/*.env*' --invert-paths
git filter-repo --path-glob '**/*.secret*' --invert-paths
git filter-repo --path-glob '**/secrets_output/**' --invert-paths

# Option 2: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner
# Download from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files "*.{env,secret}" --delete-folders secrets_output
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

### 4. üîê Implement Security Monitoring

- Enable GitHub secret scanning alerts
- Set up GitGuardian pre-commit hooks
- Implement secrets detection in CI/CD
- Regular security audits

### 5. üìã Team Communication

- Notify all team members about the incident
- Update security training
- Review and update security policies
- Document lessons learned

## Files That Need Attention

Based on GitGuardian report:
- `.env.secrets` (multiple commits)
- `interface-audit.csv` 
- `public/js/core/sallyport-auth.js`
- `server.js`
- Various `.env.bak*` files
- `secrets_output/` directory contents

## Prevention Measures

1. **Pre-commit hooks** for secret detection
2. **Regular security scans** of repositories
3. **Environment variable management** with proper tooling
4. **Team training** on secure development practices
5. **Code review processes** that include security checks
