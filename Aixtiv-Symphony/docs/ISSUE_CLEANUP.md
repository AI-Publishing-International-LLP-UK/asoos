## 🤖 Automation

### GitHub Actions
- **Auto-close Duplicates** (`.github/workflows/auto-close-duplicates.yml`)
  - Triggers when `duplicate` label is added
  - Automatically comments and closes the issue
  - Prevents future backlog accumulation

### Scripts
- **`scripts/label-issues.sh`** - Bulk apply labels to issues
- **`scripts/close-duplicates.sh`** - Close duplicate/resolved issues with proper comments

## 🔄 Ongoing Maintenance

### Weekly Issue Review
1. **Triage new issues** - Apply appropriate labels within 24 hours
2. **Check for duplicates** - Cross-reference with existing issues  
3. **Update milestones** - Ensure issues are properly tracked
4. **Consolidate similar issues** - Combine related issues into epics

### Monthly Cleanup
1. **Review resolved issues** - Close completed work
2. **Milestone assessment** - Update due dates and scope
3. **Epic reorganization** - Consolidate tracking issues
4. **Archive completed milestones** - Clean up completed work

### Quality Gates
- ❌ **No issue without labels** - All issues must be categorized
- ❌ **No duplicate issues** - Use search before creating new issues  
- ❌ **No indefinite open issues** - Regular review of stale issues
- ✅ **Clear actionable items** - Every issue should have next steps
