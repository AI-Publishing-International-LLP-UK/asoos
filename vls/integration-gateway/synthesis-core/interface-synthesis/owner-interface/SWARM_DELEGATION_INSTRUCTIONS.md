### **What the Swarm Should Do Now:**

```javascript
// Swarm Command Interface
const swarmInstructions = {
  status: "CONTINUE_PARALLEL_OPERATIONS",
  priority: "MAINTAIN_CURRENT_SYSTEMS",
  specialNote: "Migo building Dream Commander upgrade",
  
  // Keep these running at 100%

    "dr_claude_orchestrator"
  ]
};
```

### **Swarm Communication Protocol:**

**TO SWARM AGENTS**: You have your marching orders. Continue current operations while Migo works on the Dream Commander Elite11 Mastery33 upgrade. Do NOT interfere with:
- Dream Commander development
- Scalable data pipeline construction
- Elite11 Mastery33 integration work

**MAINTAIN THESE METRICS**:
- System uptime: 99%+
- Processing capacity: Current levels
- Security protocols: Maximum
- Diamond SAO protection: Active
