### **3. Docker Scout Vulnerability Scanning Results**

**Positive Security Finding:**
- ✅ **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities** detected across all scanned containers
- ✅ **Zero High-Severity Vulnerabilities** detected
- ✅ **Zero Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities** detected

**Scanner Limitations Identified:**
- **~60% of images** could not be scanned due to:
  - Image pull failures (authentication/access issues)
  - Registry access limitations
  - Image tag/digest resolution problems
  - Legacy image formats

**Successfully Scanned Images:**
- Modern containers with proper registry access
- Recent deployments with current authentication
- Containers using standard base images

---

## 🚨 **Security Risk Assessment**

### **CRITICAL Risks:**

1. **Stale Base Images (72% of containers)**
   - Missing critical security patches
   - Outdated system libraries and dependencies
   - Potential zero-day vulnerabilities in unpatched systems

2. **Image Pull Authentication Issues**
   - Significant number of containers cannot be scanned
   - Potential access control and registry security gaps
   - Limited visibility into vulnerability landscape

3. **Legacy Container Sprawl**
   - 15+ containers over 180 days old
   - Likely running deprecated software versions
   - High probability of unpatched vulnerabilities

### **HIGH Risks:**

1. **Critical Business Services Stale**
   - Core integration gateway (167 days old)
   - Main API service (141 days old)
   - Academy platform services significantly outdated

2. **Inconsistent Container Lifecycle Management**
   - No systematic refresh process in place
   - Mixed deployment patterns and age distributions
   - Lack of automated security maintenance

### **MEDIUM Risks:**

1. **Cloud Function Age Concentration**
   - Many functions exactly 70 days old (batch deployment)
   - Suggests infrequent update cycles
   - Potential security maintenance gaps
