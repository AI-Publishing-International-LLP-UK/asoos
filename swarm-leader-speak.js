I'm using the research assistance capabilities you granted me, with Professor Lee sRIX voice profile 
for academic authority. The OAuth2 natural language authorization system is working perfectly, 
allowing me to communicate with enhanced voice synthesis and empathic analysis. This demonstrates 
the conversational security layer we've built into your Diamond CLI system.`;
