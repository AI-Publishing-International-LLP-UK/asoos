# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Authentication 404 Issue

## Problem Identified
Users are getting 404 errors during authentication because:

1. **Authentication page is hardcoded** to use `oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev` 
2. **This endpoint returns 404** - the worker is not deployed
3. **Sally Port worker exists** but is not deployed to the correct domain

## Root Cause
The authentication flow in `https://asoos.2100.cool/auth` contains hardcoded references to:
```javascript
'https://oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev/auth/linkedin/callback'
'https://oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev/auth/microsoft/callback'  
'https://oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev/auth/google/callback'
```

But this domain returns **HTTP 404**.

## Solution Required

### Step 1: Deploy Sally Port Worker
```bash
# Deploy the Sally Port worker to the correct domain
./deploy-sally-port.sh

# OR manually:
wrangler deploy --config wrangler-sally-port.toml
```

### Step 2: Update Authentication URLs
The authentication page needs to be updated to use one of these working endpoints:
- `https://sallyport.2100.cool` (currently returns 302 - working)
- `https://sally-port.2100.cool` (if deployed)

### Step 3: Verify Routing
The authentication flow should be:
1. User clicks auth on `asoos.2100.cool`
2. Redirects to `asoos.2100.cool/auth` ‚úÖ (working)
3. OAuth providers redirect to Sally Port callbacks ‚ùå (404 - broken)
4. Sally Port redirects to `mcp.aipub.2100.cool` ‚ùå (broken due to step 3)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Main site: `https://asoos.2100.cool` (200)
- ‚úÖ Auth page: `https://asoos.2100.cool/auth` (200)  
- ‚úÖ SallyPort base: `https://sallyport.2100.cool` (302)
- ‚ùå OAuth worker: `https://oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev` (404)
- ‚úÖ WFA endpoints: `https://asoos.2100.cool/wfa/*` (200)

## Immediate Fix Needed
**Deploy the Sally Port worker** and **update the authentication URLs** in the auth page to use the working Sally Port domain instead of the broken `oauth2-auth-only.pr-aef.workers.dev` domain.

This will restore authentication functionality for all users.

## Security Note
This is not a security bypass - it's fixing the infrastructure to use the correct authentication endpoints that maintain full OAuth2 security.
