- All files maintain original naming for traceability
- Access patterns should be updated in application code

Next Steps:
1. Verify uploads with verify-r2-migration.sh
2. Update application code to use R2 instead of LFS
3. Test file access in staging environment
4. Clean up Git LFS after verification
