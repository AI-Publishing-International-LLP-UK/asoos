# Important Security Changes to Our GitHub Organization

**To**: All Members of AI Publishing International LLP (UK) GitHub Organization  
**From**: Organization Administration  
**Subject**: Upcoming Security Enhancements - Action Required

## What's Changing

To enhance our organization's security posture, we will be implementing two important security features:

1. **Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** - Effective [DATE]
2. **SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Effective [DATE]

## Required Actions

### For All Members:

#### 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication by [DEADLINE]:
- Log in to GitHub
- Go to Settings > Password and authentication
- Set up 2FA using an authenticator app (recommended), SMS, or security key
- Store your recovery codes in a secure location

#### 2. Prepare for SAML SSO:
- You will receive an email invitation to connect your GitHub account to our identity provider
- Follow the instructions in the email to complete the connection
- After [ENFORCEMENT DATE], you will be required to authenticate through our identity provider

## Impact

- **After [2FA DEADLINE]**: Members without 2FA will lose access to our repositories until they enable 2FA
- **After [SSO ENFORCEMENT DATE]**: All access to organization resources will require authentication through our identity provider
