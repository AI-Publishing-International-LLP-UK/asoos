## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Orchestra } from 'aixtiv-orchestra';

// Create a new orchestra instance
const orchestra = new Orchestra({
maxConcurrentServices: 10,
retryAttempts: 3,
logLevel: 'info',
enableMetrics: true
});

// Register a service
await orchestra.registerService({
id: 'llm-service-1',
name: 'Claude Integration',
type: 'llm',
status: 'idle',
config: {
    model: 'claude-3-sonnet',
    maxTokens: 4096
}
});

// Start the service
await orchestra.startService('llm-service-1');

// Monitor service status
const status = orchestra.getServiceStatus('llm-service-1');
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Service Registration

When registering a new service, ensure you provide:

- Unique service ID
- Service name and type
- Initial configuration
- Optional metadata

### Event Handling

The Orchestra uses an event-driven architecture. Subscribe to events:

```typescript
orchestra.on('service-registered', (event) => {
console.log(`New service registered: ${event.serviceId}`);
});

orchestra.on('error', (event) => {
console.error(`Error in service ${event.serviceId}:`, event.error);
});
```

### Configuration

Configure the Orchestra with appropriate settings:

- `maxConcurrentServices`: Limit concurrent service execution
- `retryAttempts`: Number of retry attempts for failed operations
- `logLevel`: Logging verbosity
- `enableMetrics`: Enable/disable metrics collection

### Best Practices

1. Always handle service errors appropriately
2. Monitor service health regularly
3. Implement proper cleanup when stopping services
4. Use type-safe service configurations
5. Maintain proper error boundaries
