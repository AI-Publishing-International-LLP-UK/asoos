- **Standard Support**: [support@example.com]
- **Support Hours**: 24/7 for Critical and High issues, 9am-5pm PT Monday-Friday for others

### 2. Escalation Path
1. Tier 1 Support: Initial response and triage
2. Tier 2 Support: Technical investigation and resolution
3. Tier 3 Support: Senior engineering and architecture team
4. Executive Escalation: CTO and service owner

### 3. Status Communication
- **Status Page**: [URL to status page]
- **Email Notifications**: Sent to registered administrators
- **Dashboard**: Real-time service health displayed in Aixtiv Symphony Dashboard

## Service Monitoring

### 1. Monitoring Systems
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring
- **Application Performance**: Custom metrics via Symphony FMS
- **End-to-End Testing**: Automated tests run every 5 minutes
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous threat detection via Dr. Grant Cybersecurity

### 2. Key Metrics Tracked
- Service availability percentage
- API response times
- Error rates and failure patterns
- Resource utilization
- Security events
- User experience metrics

### 3. Alerting Thresholds
| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Response Action |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Availability | < 99.98% | < 99.9% | Automated recovery + on-call alert |
| Response Time | > 2x normal | > 5x normal | Scale resources + investigation |
| Error Rate | > 1% | > 5% | Incident alert + investigation |
| Security Events | Any critical | Multiple critical | Security response team activation |
