# System Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the Aixtiv Symphony's system architecture, including its components, their interactions, and the overall data flow.

## Core Components

The Aixtiv Symphony Orchestrating Operating System (ASOOS) is a modular, agent-driven enterprise solution designed for decentralized systems. It integrates AI orchestration, blockchain workflows, learning prediction systems, and real-time agent delegation.

The main components of the ASOOS are:

- **The Academy**: A learning environment for both humans and AI agents.
- **The Wing**: The agent orchestration system, responsible for training, deployment, and performance tracking.
- **The Gift Shop**: An e-commerce engine.
- **Dream Commander**: A learning path prediction system.
- **RIX, CRX, & Co-Pilots**: Specialized pilot-agents.
- **Ground Crew and Tower**: Blockchain and Queen Mint Mark.
- **Integration Gateway**: A security, routing, and token control system.
- **AIRewards**: An incentive system for all users and AI.

For more details, refer to the [main README file](../../README.md).

## Data Flow

The system flow is as follows:

1. **User Authenticates**: via Sallyport + Dr. Grant Authenticator.
2. **Gateway Validates**: token, UUID role, subscription tier.
3. **User Lands in Academy / Pilots Lounge**.
4. **Dream Commander Predicts**: optimal learning path.
5. **Wing Agents Activated**: per learning/product stream.
6. **CRX Takes Over**: post-chat or post-purchase.
7. **All Events Logged to FMS** (Flight Memory System).
8. **Approvals via S2DO Smart Contracts**.

## Technical Highlights

- Modular CI/CD/CT-T with per-module `/build/` folders.
- GitOps tagging and deployment to `/deployments/`.
- Blockchain-enhanced workflows via `dr-burby-s2do-blockchain/`.
- Scalable vector search via `data/vector-db/`.
- Role segmentation via `UserTypeMatrix` and Gateway role-based access logic.
