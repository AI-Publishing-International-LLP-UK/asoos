# Rollback Plan

This document details the process for rolling back to a previous version of the Aixtiv Symphony in case of a failed deployment.

## Automated Rollback

The primary rollback mechanism is automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. If a deployment fails any of the post-deployment health checks, the system will automatically roll back to the previously deployed version.

### Health Checks

The following health checks are performed after each deployment:

- **API Health**: Verifies that all API endpoints are responding with a `200 OK` status.
- **Database Connectivity**: Ensures that the system can connect to the database and perform basic queries.
- **Service Availability**: Checks that all critical services are running and available.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Runs a small suite of end-to-end tests to verify that the core functionality is working as expected.

## Manual Rollback

In the event that the automated rollback fails or a critical issue is discovered after the deployment has been completed, a manual rollback can be initiated.

To initiate a manual rollback, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Last Known Good Version**: Determine the version of the system to which you want to roll back.
2. **Trigger the Rollback Pipeline**: Run the rollback pipeline in the CI/CD system, specifying the version to which you want to roll back.
3. **Verify the Rollback**: Once the rollback is complete, perform a full system health check to ensure that the system is stable and functioning correctly.

## Post-Rollback Analysis

After any rollback, a post-mortem analysis should be conducted to determine the root cause of the failure and identify steps to prevent similar issues in the future.
