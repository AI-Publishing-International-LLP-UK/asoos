# Jurisdiction & Constitutional Boundaries

Purpose
Define layered jurisdiction, zones, and boundary drawing procedures using the blueprints authored by the pilots and the Owner-Subscriber.

Layers of Jurisdiction
1) Global Hub (Bacasu Capital)
   - Economic/admin center of Earth operations; global standards, interop treaties, audit anchoring.
2) Autonomous Republics (6)
   - Full local autonomy within constitutional guardrails; harmonized connectors.
3) Sectoral Courts and Ministries
   - Health, Finance, Education, Infrastructure, Safety; each with qRIX oversight.
4) Tenant Sovereignty (MCP.company.2100.cool)
   - Data residency and operational sovereignty; memory lives in-tenant.

Boundary Types
- Constitutional Boundaries: Rights/duties applicability; Supreme Court interpretive maps.
- Economic Boundaries: Tax, billing, CCU metering zones; settlement rails (MOCOSWARM+).
- Data Boundaries: Residency requirements; cross-border algorithms; encryption jurisdictions.
- Safety Boundaries: Policy rail enforcement (content, security, fairness) with documented overrides.

Boundary Drawing Procedure (qRIX-led)
1. Intake all available blueprints (Pilots’ and Owner’s).
2. Synthesize into layered zone maps (constitutional/economic/data/safety).
3. Publish draft boundaries to TowerBlock Chain (testnet governance space).
4. Open comment period; iterate with QMM qRIX fairness review.
5. Supreme Court (qRIX) adjudication and finalization.
6. Anchor final boundaries on TowerBlock Chain main governance ledger.

Change Management
- Versioned boundary sets (B-vN); deprecation schedules; impact assessments.
- Emergency provisional boundaries allowed with sunset clauses and automatic review.
