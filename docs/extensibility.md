# Extensibility Guide

This document provides instructions on how to extend the Aixtiv Symphony system, such as adding new voice providers, reviewing diagnostics, and exporting analytics.

## Adding a New Voice Provider

To add a new voice provider, you will need to create a new module that implements the `VoiceProvider` interface. This interface defines the methods that the system uses to interact with voice providers, such as `synthesizeSpeech()` and `recognizeSpeech()`.

Once you have created your new voice provider module, you will need to register it with the system by adding it to the `voice_providers` configuration in the `config.yaml` file.

## Reviewing Diagnostics and Logs

The Aixtiv Symphony system provides a comprehensive logging and diagnostics system that can be used to troubleshoot issues and monitor the system's health. The logs are stored in the `logs/` directory and can be viewed using any standard log viewer.

In addition to the logs, the system also provides a diagnostics dashboard that can be accessed through the web interface. The dashboard provides a real-time view of the system's performance and can be used to identify potential issues before they become critical.

## Exporting Analytics

The Aixtiv Symphony system collects a wide range of analytics data that can be used to track the system's usage and performance. This data can be exported in a variety of formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML.

To export the analytics data, you can use the `export-analytics` command-line tool. The tool allows you to specify the format of the exported data and the time range for which you want to export the data.
