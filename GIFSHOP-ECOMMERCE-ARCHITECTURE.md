# 🎯 PART II: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

## 2.1 Clean Architecture Principles

### **Separation of Concerns**
```typescript
// Domain Layer
interface SubscriptionPlan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: SubscriptionType;
  agentCount: number;
  monthlyPrice: number;
  features: Feature[];
}

// Application Layer
class SubscriptionService {
  async createSubscription(planId: string, userId: string): Promise<Subscription>
  async upgradeSubscription(subscriptionId: string, newPlanId: string): Promise<Subscription>
  async cancelSubscription(subscriptionId: string): Promise<void>
}

// Infrastructure Layer
class PaymentGateway {
  async processPayment(amount: number, paymentMethod: PaymentMethod): Promise<PaymentResult>
}
```

### **Shared Components Architecture**
```typescript
// Reusable UI Components
export const PricingCard: React.FC<PricingCardProps>
export const SubscriptionSelector: React.FC<SubscriptionSelectorProps>
export const AgentCountDisplay: React.FC<AgentCountProps>
export const FeatureList: React.FC<FeatureListProps>

// Business Logic Services
export class PricingCalculator
export class SubscriptionValidator
export class AgentAllocationService
export class BillingService
```

## 2.2 Integration Points

### **Authentication Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User visits gifshop.2100.cool] --> B{Authenticated?}
    B -->|No| C[Redirect to sallyport.2100.cool]
    B -->|Yes| D[Show personalized catalog]
    C --> E[Complete authentication]
    E --> F[Return to gifshop with token]
    F --> D
    D --> G[Select subscription]
    G --> H[Checkout process]
    H --> I[Deploy MCP on Quantswarm VM]
```

### **MCP Integration**
```typescript
interface MCPDeploymentService {
  async deployMCP(subscriptionId: string, planType: SubscriptionType): Promise<MCPInstance>
  async allocateAgents(mcpId: string, agentCount: number): Promise<AgentAllocation>
  async configureDashboard(mcpId: string, features: Feature[]): Promise<DashboardConfig>
}
```

## 2.3 Payment & Billing Integration

### **Multi-Tier Payment Processing**
```typescript
class PaymentProcessor {
  // Individual payments
  async processIndividualPayment(amount: number, card: CreditCard): Promise<PaymentResult>
  
  // Professional payments with invoicing
  async processProfessionalPayment(amount: number, invoice: InvoiceDetails): Promise<PaymentResult>
  
  // Academic payments with verification
  async processAcademicPayment(amount: number, academicVerification: AcademicID): Promise<PaymentResult>
  
  // Enterprise payments with purchase orders
  async processEnterprisePayment(amount: number, purchaseOrder: PO): Promise<PaymentResult>
}
```

# 🛡️ PART IV: PREVENTING CODE CHAOS

## 4.1 Architecture Patterns

### **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Clear domain boundaries for each subscription type
- Shared kernel for common functionality
- Anti-corruption layers for external integrations

### **Clean Architecture**
- Domain logic independent of frameworks
- Dependency inversion for testability
- Clear separation between layers

### **Microservices Architecture**
```
Subscription Service    → Manages subscription lifecycle
Payment Service        → Handles all payment processing
MCP Deployment Service → Manages Quantswarm VM deployment
Notification Service   → Handles email/SMS notifications
Analytics Service      → Tracks usage & metrics
```

## 4.2 Code Organization Standards

### **TypeScript Strictness**
```typescript
// Strict type definitions
interface SubscriptionPlan {
  readonly id: SubscriptionPlanId;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly type: SubscriptionType;
  readonly pricing: PricingTier;
  readonly features: readonly Feature[];
}

// Runtime validation
const subscriptionPlanSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string().min(1),
  type: z.enum(['individual', 'professional', 'academic', 'team', 'enterprise']),
  // ...
});
```

### **Testing Strategy**
```typescript
// Unit tests for each service
describe('SubscriptionService', () => {
  it('should create individual subscription successfully')
  it('should apply academic discount correctly')
  it('should handle payment failures gracefully')
})

// Integration tests for flows
describe('Subscription Flow Integration', () => {
  it('should complete end-to-end individual signup')
  it('should deploy MCP after successful payment')
})
```

## 4.3 Shared Component Library

### **Reusable UI Components**
```typescript
// Pricing components
export const PricingTable: React.FC<PricingTableProps>
export const PlanComparison: React.FC<PlanComparisonProps>
export const AgentCounter: React.FC<AgentCounterProps>

// Subscription management
export const SubscriptionCard: React.FC<SubscriptionCardProps>
export const UsageMetrics: React.FC<UsageMetricsProps>
export const BillingHistory: React.FC<BillingHistoryProps>

// Gift experience
export const GiftCustomizer: React.FC<GiftCustomizerProps>
export const RecipientSelector: React.FC<RecipientSelectorProps>
```
