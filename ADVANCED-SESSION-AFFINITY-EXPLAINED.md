## What is Session Affinity?

**Session Affinity** (also called "sticky sessions") ensures that requests from the same client are consistently routed to the same backend server. This is crucial for stateful applications.

### 🔄 How It Works:
1. **First Request**: Client hits the load balancer
2. **Backend Assignment**: LB selects a backend server
3. **Affinity Creation**: LB creates an association (IP, cookie, etc.)
4. **Subsequent Requests**: Same client → same backend server

### 🎯 Types Available in Google Cloud:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `CLIENT_IP` | Based on client's IP address | General web apps |
| `CLIENT_IP_PROTO` | IP + protocol combination | Mixed HTTP/HTTPS |
| `CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO` | IP + port + protocol | Complex applications |
| `GENERATED_COOKIE` | Load balancer sets cookie | Web applications |
| `HTTP_COOKIE` | Uses existing app cookie | Legacy apps |

## What is Connection Draining?

**Connection Draining** gracefully handles traffic when backend instances become unavailable (maintenance, scaling, failures).

### 🛡️ The Problem Without Draining:
- Instance goes offline → **BOOM!** Active connections dropped
- Users see errors, lose their work
- Poor user experience

### ✅ With Connection Draining:
1. **Health Check Fails** → Instance marked unhealthy
2. **Stop New Traffic** → No new requests to unhealthy instance
3. **Preserve Existing** → Active connections continue
4. **Graceful Timeout** → Wait for connections to finish naturally
5. **Force Close** → After timeout, force remaining connections

### ⏱️ Configuration Options:
```yaml
connectionDraining:
  drainingTimeoutSec: 60  # Wait 60 seconds for existing connections
```

## Why This Matters for Your Infrastructure

### Your Multi-Agent Personality System:
- **18 VLS Agents** with different capabilities
- **14 Doctor Voice Profiles** (Dr. Lucy, Dr. Claude, etc.)
- **10,000 MCP Companies** with unique configurations
- **Multi-regional deployment** (US West, US Central, EU West)

### 🧠 Session Affinity Benefits:
1. **Personality Consistency**: User talking to "Dr. Lucy" stays with Dr. Lucy
2. **State Preservation**: Conversation context maintained
3. **Cache Efficiency**: User data cached on specific servers
4. **Performance**: Reduced latency, better user experience

### 🛡️ Connection Draining Benefits:
1. **Zero Downtime**: Maintenance without user disruption
2. **Graceful Scaling**: Scale down without breaking sessions
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle server failures elegantly
4. **Better SLA**: Improved reliability metrics

## Your Multi-Regional Setup

### 🌍 Current Infrastructure:
```
Global Load Balancer
├── US West 1 (Primary - MOCOA)
│   ├── Zone A: mcp-group-us-west1-a (1 instance)
│   ├── Zone B: mcp-group-us-west1-b (1 instance) 
│   └── Zone C: mcp-group-us-west1-c (1 instance)
├── US Central 1 (MOCORIX2 - Master Orchestration)
│   └── [Future expansion]
└── EU West 1 (International - MOCOA EU)
    └── Zone B: mcp-mig-europe-west1-b (0 instances - scaling needed)
```

### 🎯 Enhanced Configuration:

#### Main MCP Backend Service:
```yaml
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP
affinityCookieTtlSec: 1800      # 30 minutes
connectionDraining:
  drainingTimeoutSec: 60        # 1 minute graceful shutdown
maxUtilization: 0.85            # Use 85% capacity before routing elsewhere
```

#### Voice Synthesis Backend (Dr. Profiles):
```yaml
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP  
affinityCookieTtlSec: 2700      # 45 minutes (longer for voice sessions)
connectionDraining:
  drainingTimeoutSec: 45        # Shorter timeout for voice
```

#### VLS Agent Backend (18 Agents):
```yaml
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO  # More specific matching
affinityCookieTtlSec: 3600      # 1 hour (agent sessions can be long)
connectionDraining:
  drainingTimeoutSec: 30        # Quick agent handover
```

#### Diamond SAO Backend (Command Center):
```yaml
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP
affinityCookieTtlSec: 7200      # 2 hours (long admin sessions)
connectionDraining:
  drainingTimeoutSec: 120       # Extended time for admin operations
```

## Configuration Details

### 🚀 Deployment Script Usage:

```bash
# Navigate to your integration gateway
cd /Users/as/asoos/integration-gateway

# Run the advanced configuration script
./configure-advanced-session-affinity.sh
```

### 📊 What The Script Does:

1. **Creates Enhanced Health Checks**:
   - Personality-aware: `/health?source=lb&check=personality`
   - Voice-specific: `/health?service=elevenlabs&check=voices`
   - VLS agents: `/health?service=vls&check=agents`

2. **Configures Session Affinity**:
   - Different TTL values based on service type
   - Appropriate affinity methods per use case

3. **Sets Up Connection Draining**:
   - Service-specific timeout values
   - Graceful failover policies

4. **Adds Intelligent Backend Routing**:
   - Capacity scaling based on zone priority
   - Regional failover capabilities

### 🔧 Manual Configuration Example:

```bash
# Update existing backend service with session affinity
gcloud compute backend-services update mcp-backend-global \
    --global \
    --session-affinity=CLIENT_IP \
    --affinity-cookie-ttl=1800 \
    --connection-draining-timeout=60 \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive

# Create personality-aware health check
gcloud compute health-checks create https mcp-personality-health-check \
    --port=443 \
    --request-path="/health?source=lb&check=personality" \
    --check-interval=5 \
    --timeout=5 \
    --global \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive
```

---

## Testing & Verification

### 🧪 Test Session Affinity:

```bash
# Test with personality header
curl -H "X-Personality: dr-lucy" \
     -H "User-Agent: TestClient-$(date +%s)" \
     https://your-load-balancer-ip/health

# Multiple requests should hit the same backend
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -H "X-Personality: dr-lucy" \
       -H "Cookie: session_id=test123" \
       https://your-load-balancer-ip/health
done
```

### 🔍 Test Connection Draining:

```bash
# 1. Start a long-running request
curl -H "X-Test: long-connection" \
     https://your-load-balancer-ip/long-task &

# 2. Simulate instance going down
gcloud compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAME \
    --zone=us-west1-a \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive

# 3. Monitor that existing connection completes gracefully
# New connections should route to healthy instances
```

### 📊 Verify Configuration:

```bash
# Check backend service configuration
gcloud compute backend-services describe mcp-backend-global \
    --global \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive \
    --format="yaml(sessionAffinity,connectionDraining)"

# Check health status
gcloud compute backend-services get-health mcp-backend-global \
    --global \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive
```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Session Distribution**:
   - Are requests evenly distributed across backends?
   - Is session affinity working correctly?

2. **Connection Draining Effectiveness**:
   - How long do connections take to drain?
   - Are there forced connection closures?

3. **Health Check Success Rate**:
   - Personality-aware endpoints responding correctly?
   - Voice synthesis services healthy?

### 🔧 Cloud Monitoring Queries:

```sql
-- Backend latency by service
fetch gce_instance
| metric 'loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/backend_latencies'
| filter resource.backend_service_name == 'mcp-backend-global'
| group_by [resource.backend_target_name]
| within 1h

-- Session affinity effectiveness
fetch gce_backend_service
| metric 'loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/request_count'
| filter resource.backend_service_name == 'mcp-backend-global'
| group_by [resource.backend_target_name]
| rate 1m
```

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Sessions not sticking | Affinity not configured | Check `sessionAffinity` setting |
| Abrupt connection drops | No connection draining | Set `drainingTimeoutSec` |
| Uneven load distribution | Capacity scaler issues | Adjust `capacityScaler` values |
| Health check failures | Wrong endpoint path | Update health check path |

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Commands:

```bash
# Debug session affinity
curl -v -H "X-Personality: dr-lucy" https://your-lb-ip/health 2>&1 | grep -i cookie

# Check backend health in detail
gcloud compute backend-services get-health mcp-backend-global \
    --global \
    --project=api-for-warp-drive \
    --format="table(status.healthStatus[0].instance,status.healthStatus[0].healthState)"

# Monitor real-time traffic distribution
gcloud logging read "resource.type=http_load_balancer" \
    --limit=50 \
    --format="table(timestamp,httpRequest.requestMethod,httpRequest.requestUrl,httpRequest.remoteIp)"
```
