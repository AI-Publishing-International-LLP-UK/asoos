#### **Performance Metrics Calculation:**
```
Latency: 6ms
- Measured: Average API response time across 10M daily transactions
- Sample Size: 30-day rolling average
- Measurement Points: Database queries, API calls, external service calls
- Calculation: (Total Response Time) / (Total Requests) = 6ms average

Throughput: 100K ops/sec  
- Measured: Peak concurrent operations during high-traffic periods
- Sample Period: Black Friday/Cyber Monday stress testing
- Operations Include: Transactions, searches, listings, API calls
- Sustained Rate: 85K ops/sec | Burst Capacity: 100K ops/sec

Compliance: 84%
- Measured: PCI DSS, GDPR, marketplace regulations adherence
