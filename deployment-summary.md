# Dr. Claude Function Deployment Summary

## Successfully Completed:
1. Created cloud function code for dr-claude with /projects/delegate endpoint
2. Deployed the cloud function to: `https://us-west1-api-for-warp-drive.cloudfunctions.net/dr-claude`
3. Updated the .env file with the correct endpoint URL
4. Verified the health check endpoint is working: `/`
5. Successfully tested the delegate command: `claude:agent:delegate`
6. Verified the status command is still working: `claude:status`

## Still Needs Implementation:
1. The code:generate command functionality in the cloud function
   - Would need to implement a `/claude-code-generate` endpoint
   - Needs to integrate with the Anthropic API for code generation

## Current Configuration:
```
CLAUDE_API_ENDPOINT=https://us-west1-api-for-warp-drive.cloudfunctions.net
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=[Your API key is correctly set]
```

## Next Steps:
1. To implement code generation functionality, add a new endpoint to the cloud function
2. Update the code:generate.js file if needed to align with your cloud function design
3. Consider setting up CI/CD for automatic deployments of the cloud function
