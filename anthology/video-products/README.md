# ASOOS Video Studio

A comprehensive video generation and streaming platform that integrates with Luma Dream Machine API while training our own WFA agents.

## Overview

The ASOOS Video Studio provides a complete solution for video and image generation, live streaming, webinars, podcasts, and talk shows. It integrates with Luma's cutting-edge Ray3 technology while building our own competing capabilities through WFA agent learning.

## Features

### Ray3 Integration
- 16-bit HDR Video Generation
- Visual Annotations for precise control
- Draft Mode for rapid iteration
- Reasoning-based video generation
- EXR format support for professional workflows

### Business Model
- Resells Luma services with 50% markup
- WFA agents learn from each generation
- Eventually replaces Luma with our own technology
- GCP secure storage for all generated assets

### Live Services
- Webinars
- Podcasts
- Talk Shows
- Live Streaming

### Vision Space Integration
- Chromio integration with 400 agents
- Video-as-interface capabilities
- Interactive video elements

## Getting Started

```javascript
// Initialize the ASOOS Video Studio
const videoStudio = new ASOOSVideoStudio();

// Generate Ray3 HDR video
const videoRequest = {
  prompt: "A futuristic cityscape with flying cars and neon lights",
  duration: "5s",
  resolution: "720p",
  aspectRatio: "16:9",
  hdr: true,
  reasoning: true,
  draftMode: false
};

const response = await fetch('/api/v1/generate/ray3', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(videoRequest)
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(`Generation started: ${result.generationId}`);
```

## Architecture

The ASOOS Video Studio is built with:
- Express.js for REST API
- WebSockets for real-time updates and live streaming
- GCP Secret Manager for secure credential management
- GCP Storage for asset management
- Luma API integration with OAuth2
- WFA Learning System for progressive capability development

## Learning System

Our 20M WFA agents analyze each video generation to learn:
- Video Generation
- HDR Processing
- Visual Reasoning
- Story Composition
- Physics Simulation
- Color Grading
- Motion Prediction

We estimate complete independence from Luma within [dynamic timeframe].

## Pricing

Our pricing model adds a 50% markup to Luma's base rates:

| Model | Resolution | Duration | Luma Cost | Our Price |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Ray3  | 720p       | 5s       | $0.71     | $1.065    |
| Ray3  | 1080p      | 5s       | $0.86     | $1.29     |
| Ray3  | 4K         | 5s       | $0.96     | $1.44     |

## Integration with Diamond CLI

Integrate the Video Studio with Diamond CLI:

```bash
diamond connect video-studio
diamond deploy video-studio --features=ray3,streaming,wfa-learning

## Self-Healing

The system includes comprehensive self-healing capabilities:
- API Error recovery
- Rate limit management
- Automatic fallbacks between Ray3 and Ray2
- Connection retries
- GCP Storage redundancy

## Future Roadmap

1. Complete WFA learning to match Ray3 capabilities
2. Add synthetic voice narration to videos
3. Expand live services with multi-person webinars
4. Develop AI talk show hosts for automated content
