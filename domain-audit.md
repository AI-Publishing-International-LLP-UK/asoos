## Cloudflare Pages Projects Analysis

### KEEP - Production Projects
1. **2100-cool-primary** - Serves 2100.cool domain ‚úÖ
2. **asoos-2100-cool-landing** - Current working directory, serves asoos.2100.cool ‚úÖ
3. **api-for-warp-drive** - Integration hub ‚úÖ
4. **coaching2100-com** - Likely serves coaching2100.com ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **coach-2100-cool** - Likely serves coach.2100.cool ‚ö†Ô∏è

### INVESTIGATE BEFORE DELETE

- **2100-cool** - May be duplicate of 2100-cool-primary  
- **dr-memoria-anthology** - Unknown purpose
- **drclaude-production** - May be production system
- **coaching2100-clean** - May be active version

### SAFE TO DELETE (Old/Test Projects)
- **asoos-clean-deploy-2025** - ‚úÖ ALREADY DELETED
- Others TBD after domain mapping verification

## Action Plan
1. ‚úÖ Verify domain bindings for each project
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix coach.2100.cool and sallyport.2100.cool
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix coaching2100.com authentication
4. üîÑ Only delete projects after confirming no domain dependencies

## Security Concerns
- Multiple KV stores with sensitive tokens need consolidation
- GCP Secret Manager migration required for auth tokens
- Domain-to-project mappings need verification
