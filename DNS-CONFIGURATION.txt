DNS CONFIGURATION FOR CLOUDFLARE DASHBOARD
==========================================

LOCATION: dash.cloudflare.com → 2100.cool zone → DNS section

ADD THESE 2 DNS RECORDS:

RECORD 1: asoos.2100.cool
-------------------------

------------------------------
Type: A
Name: sallyport
IPv4 address: 192.0.2.1
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud ENABLED)

CRITICAL SETTINGS:
- Orange cloud (Proxy) MUST be ON for both records
- Use 192.0.2.1 as placeholder IP (Cloudflare proxies traffic)
- TTL should be "Auto"
- Only enter subdomain in Name field (asoos, sallyport)

AFTER DNS IS SET:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to take effect
2. Test: https://asoos.2100.cool/wfa/status (should work)
3. Deploy Pages for asoos.2100.cool main site
4. Deploy auth service for sallyport.2100.cool

CURRENT WORKER STATUS:
✅ asoos.2100.cool/wfa/* → WFA API (working)
❌ asoos.2100.cool/* → Landing page (needs Pages deployment)
❌ sallyport.2100.cool/* → Authentication (needs deployment)
