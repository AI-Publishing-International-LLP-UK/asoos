SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
1. The claude:status command works because it reads directly from Firestore, not via an API call.
2. The claude:agent:delegate command is failing because it's trying to call a cloud function that doesn't exist at the URL:
   https://us-west1-aixtiv-symphony.cloudfunctions.net/dr-claude/projects/delegate
3. From the list of cloud functions in your project, there is no function called 'dr-claude'.
4. There is a function called 'claudeCodeGenerate' in us-central1, but it's OFFLINE.
5. The API key 'lucy-claude-01' has been correctly retrieved and set in the .env file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Deploy the missing 'dr-claude' cloud function in us-west1 region.
2. Alternatively, update the CLAUDE_API_ENDPOINT in the .env file to point to a different existing function.
3. Check if the claudeCodeGenerate function in us-central1 should be reactivated.

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
CLAUDE_API_ENDPOINT=https://us-west1-aixtiv-symphony.cloudfunctions.net
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-****************************

PROJECT_DELEGATE_ENDPOINT=const PROJECT_DELEGATE_ENDPOINT = `${CLAUDE_API_ENDPOINT}/dr-claude/projects/delegate`;
