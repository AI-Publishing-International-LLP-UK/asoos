# Aixtiv Symphony Opus Consolidation Plan

## Objective
Consolidate Aixtiv Symphony Opus components into a unified, modular, and containerized architecture under `/Users/as/asoos/opus/opus1.0.1`.

## Components to Integrate
1. CRX and RIX agent pairs
2. VLS (Vision Lake Solutions) components
3. Integration Gateway
4. Deployment and CI/CD infrastructure

## Consolidation Steps

### Phase 1: Repository Setup (Completed)
- [x] Create main directory structure
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Create development branch (symphonic-dev)
- [x] Add .gitignore and README

### Phase 2: Component Integration
- [ ] Extract and validate agent bundle contents
- [ ] Integrate CRX agents into agent-pairs/crx
- [ ] Integrate RIX agents into agent-pairs/rix
- [ ] Identify and document agent pair relationships
- [ ] Create identity files for each agent

### Phase 3: Containerization
- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for each VLS solution
- [ ] Set up container build scripts
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Document container networking and dependencies

### Phase 4: CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Configure deployment pipelines
- [ ] Set up staging and production environments
- [ ] Implement automated testing and verification

### Phase 5: Documentation and Handoff
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Train team on new architecture
- [ ] Finalize QA audit and certification

## Integration Rules
1. Maintain modular structure for each component
2. Ensure all agents have proper identity files
3. Standardize deployment patterns
4. Implement version control for all components
5. Document dependencies and integration points

## Timeline
[Timeline details to be added]

## Resources
- Agent bundles (ZIP files) containing CRX-RIX pairs
- Deployment kits
- QA audit requirements
