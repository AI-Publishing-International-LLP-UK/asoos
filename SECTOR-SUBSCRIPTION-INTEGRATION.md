- **Professional**: Solo practitioner service level (1,000-25,000 agents) 
- **Academic**: Educational service level (500-500,000 agents)
- **Team/SMB**: Small business service level (2,500-100,000 agents)
- **Enterprise**: Corporate service level (250,000-unlimited agents)
- **Custom**: Bespoke service level (fully customized)
- **Gift**: Experience service level (temporary access)

### **200 SECTORS = CONTENT & SPECIALIZATION**
These determine **WHAT** AI agents and intelligence they get:
- Healthcare, Legal, Manufacturing, Government, Financial, etc.
- Each sector has specialized AI agents, compliance requirements, DIDC archives
- All 200 sectors are available to ALL subscription types
