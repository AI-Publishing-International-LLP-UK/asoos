# Aixtiv CLI Output Enhancement

This project enhances the Aixtiv CLI to display both internal reasoning and execution results.

## Features

- Clearly labeled internal thought process
- Separated execution results
- Color-coded output for better readability

## Usage

1. Run the fix-cli-output.js script to apply the enhancements:

```bash
node debug-output-fix/fix-cli-output.js
```

2. Use any CLI command as normal, and you'll now see both the internal reasoning and the execution results:

```bash
./bin/aixtiv.js claude:code:generate --task "Create a factorial function"
```

## Customization

You can modify the debug-display.js module to customize how the output is formatted and displayed.
