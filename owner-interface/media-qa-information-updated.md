## **DISCOVERY & EVIDENCE QUESTIONS**

### **About the July 1-2 Discovery**
**Q:** What exactly happened on July 1-2, 2025 in Mexico City?
**A:** Our team achieved breakthrough moments demonstrating true AGI - intelligence that can learn and adapt across multiple domains, not just single tasks like current AI systems.

**Q:** How do you prove this is AGI and not just advanced narrow AI?
**A:** We have concrete evidence: ARC Prize application results as of September 4, 2025, showing general problem-solving capabilities, plus 45 USPTO patent filings documenting our breakthrough methods.

**Q:** What makes your AGI different from ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI systems?
**A:** Those are still narrow AI, trained for specific tasks. Our AGI demonstrates general intelligence - it can learn new domains without being specifically trained for them.

**Q:** Can you show us the ARC application results?
**A:** Yes, we'll demonstrate the specific performance metrics from our July 1-2 breakthrough and our current results as of September 4, 2025.

## **BUSINESS & ACCESS QUESTIONS**

### **About Latin America First**
**Q:** Why are you launching in Latin America before Silicon Valley or other tech hubs?
**A:** Our region deserves to be first with a 30-day head start. We discovered AGI here in Mexico City, so we're giving Latin America the first commercial access to this breakthrough.

**Q:** What's the actual offer for Latin American companies and individuals?
**A:** We're opening spaces for 1,000 companies and 1,000 individuals in Latin America with a 90% discount. We will honor this discount until we establish a 2025 baseline of revenues.

**Q:** What happens after the discount period?
**A:** From 2026, we'll offer regular licenses or 2% of revenue growth as the license fee. We're certain most will see significant growth, but many factors will determine outcomes.

**Q:** How do companies and individuals apply for access?
**A:** Through our 2100.cool platform launching today. Selection will be based on readiness and commitment to provide honest feedback.

**Q:** What's your commitment to these first users?
**A:** We are dedicated to making the world's first 1,000 individuals and 1,000 companies to use commercially available AGI as successful as possible.

**Q:** What does "readiness" mean for companies?
**A:** It could be "We have nothing yet and this will help us start" or "We're advanced and AGI will push us further." We welcome both.

## **REGIONAL IMPACT QUESTIONS**

### **About Mexico and Latin America**
**Q:** What does this mean for Mexico's position in global technology?
**A:** Mexico City becomes the birthplace of AGI - a historic achievement that positions our region as a technology leader, not follower.

**Q:** What is the AI Day proposal for October 13?
**A:** We propose merging Columbus Day with AI Day to celebrate the discovery of AGI in Mexico City and create a Pan-American technology celebration.

**Q:** How do you compete with Google, Microsoft, OpenAI?
**A:** We're not competing - we achieved AGI first. Now we're focusing on responsible, community-centered deployment rather than corporate concentration.

**Q:** What's Civilization AI?

## **PRICING & BUSINESS MODEL QUESTIONS**

### **About the Financial Structure**
**Q:** Why 90% discount instead of free access?
**A:** We need to establish a baseline of commercial viability while making AGI accessible. The discount ensures serious commitment while building sustainable revenue.

**Q:** What is the 2% revenue growth license model?
**A:** From 2026, successful companies can choose to pay 2% of their revenue growth attributable to AGI instead of fixed licensing fees.

**Q:** What if a company doesn't see revenue growth?
**A:** We're confident most will see significant growth, but many factors determine outcomes. We're committed to making these first users as successful as possible.

**Q:** How do you ensure companies succeed with AGI?
**A:** Dedicated support, transparent feedback loops, and our commitment to making the world's first 1,000 companies using commercial AGI successful.

## **TRANSPARENCY & TRUST QUESTIONS**

### **About Honest Testimonies**
**Q:** How can people trust these claims?
**A:** Starting next week, our Latin America cohort members will share personal testimonies - both positive experiences and challenges.

**Q:** What if the technology doesn't work as promised?
**A:** That's exactly why we're being transparent. Real voices from real users will provide the evidence people need to make decisions.

**Q:** Will you share failures along with successes?
**A:** Absolutely. We've asked our cohort to be honest about ups and downs. Transparency builds trust better than perfection claims.

**Q:** How do you ensure this benefits communities, not just corporations?
**A:** By anchoring AGI in regional settlements with cultural sovereignty, local governance, and community feedback loops.
